# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
V. Isualize has given myself and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Method 
Having merged the ride and city datasets, I calculated the total rides grouped by city type, driver counts by city type, and total fares by city type. 
That allowed me to calculate the avgerage fare by city type and average fare per driver by city type. 
The summary statistics resulting from these calculations are provided below.

## Results 
We see that urban areas have the largest number of totoal ride, total drivers, total fares, followed by suburban areas. While rural areas have the least number of total rides, total drivera, and total fares. There is a inverse relationship between these metrics and the associated costs. Average Fare per Ride and Avg Fare by Driver are the highest in rural areas, followed by suburban areas. Urban areas the cheapest Average Fares per Ride and Average Fares per Driver. 

My hypothesis is that in urban areas where ride sharing is in higher demand, there are a greater number of drivers and therefore pricing is more compeitive. While in rural areas there are fewer drivers to meet the demand and therefore drivers can charge a higher fare. 

A second hypothesis is that in urban areas destinations are more concentrated and so trips are shorter, leading to lower average fares. Wheras in rural areas desatinations may be spread farther apart and thus individual trips longer and more costly.

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
